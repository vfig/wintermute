// Readable 1, index decal 0, group 0/64:
// NOTE: If the pages start at anything other than zero, the decals do not work.
//       And technically we don't need the "NOT DISCOVERED" decal, but decals
//       have to be in serial order, or the later ones will not show. So since
//       we are copy-pasting here, it is easier to leave it in.
